# Black Box

URL: https://blackbox.ipinfo.app/

Black Box is a replacement to a now discontinued website apis, http://proxy.mind-media.com/block/ and http://www.shroomery.org/ythan/proxycheck.php, that provided a way to determine if an IP address was a likely proxy. 

## Community Forum

If you need help, have questions, or want to share advice the community forum is the place to be: https://www.hostvein.net/forums/ipinfo-app.7/

## Goals

* Fast! 
* Drop-in replacement to the old API.
* Rethink and utilize ASNs to map common hosting providers instead of a manual list of ips. 
* Add TOR Exit Node IPs into the list.
* IPv6 Support.
* JSON supported formats.

## Blocks

The Blocks directory are additions to our other lists we utilize to generate our proxy, hosting, and tor lists.

If you find an IP address that you have determined needs to be added to the list please create an issue with the IP address, and why it should be added. 

## Help Me Help You!

If you find a Proxy IP or a hosting providers ASN. Please create a commit and add it to the repository. This will save me time, and allow you a better preforming proxy checker. 


## Beta!

This project is still in beta, and we are working on improving it further. Help me test it out!
