# Black Box

URL: https://blackbox.ipinfo.app/lookup/8.8.8.8

Black Box is a replacement to a now discontinued website api that provided a way to determine if an IP address was a likely proxy. 

## Goals

 * Fast! 
 * Drop-in replacement to the old API.
 * Rethink and utilize ASNs to map common hosting providers instead of a manual list of ips. 
 * Add TOR Exit Node IPs into the list.
 * IPv6 Support.
 
 ## Blocks
 
 The Blocks directory are additions to our other lists we utilize to generate our proxy, hosting, and tor lists.
 
 If you find an IP address that you have determined needs to be added to the list please create an issue with the IP address, and why it should be added. 
 
 ## Beta!
 
 This project is still in beta, and we are working on improving it further. Help me test it out!
